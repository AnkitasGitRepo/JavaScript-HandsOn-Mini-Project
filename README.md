#--------- Practice1 Mini Project ---------#
Overview:
This mini-project is designed to provide an interactive way for users to change the background color of a 
webpage or a specific element by entering the name of a color into a text field.

Functionality:
When a user types a color name (such as "blue," "red," "green," etc.) into the text field and submits it,
the background color of the page (or a specified section) changes to the entered color. The project utilizes 
JavaScript to create a seamless and responsive user experience.

User Interaction:
The user types a color name into the provided text input field.
Upon pressing enter or clicking the submit button, the background color of the page updates to match the entered color.
